# mess2pdf

This is a script I wrote to make grading student papers easier. When students upload their scratch work from exams and projects into the Assignments area of D2L/Brightspace they generally upload them as a group of image files. It is much easier for me to grade a single pdf document, so I wrote this script to convert all image files into pdf, and then combine those pdf documents into a single pdf.

If you're using Windows or Linux you will need a copy of (ImageMagik)[https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php] in order to convert HEIC images to pdf. Just make sure the executable file is in the same directory as the mess2pdf script or in another directory that is accessible through your PATH environment variable.
